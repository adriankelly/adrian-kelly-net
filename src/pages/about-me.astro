					Hi, I'm Adrian, a Customer Education Manager with a background spanning multiple continents and disciplines. Born in New Zealand
					and raised in Australia, I studied law and political science before diving into the world of research analysis and working in
					London as a web developer. I draw on these experiences as a Customer Education Manager, helping me reduce complex concepts into
					clear, user-friendly content, and to leverage my analytical skills to inform content strategy and improve content performance.
				</p><br />
				<p>
					Outside of work, I'm an avid runner and hiker, finding peace and inspiration in the trails of Haute Savoie, France where I live
					with my wife and two daughters. Music is another passion of mine, offering a creative outlet and a way to unwind.
